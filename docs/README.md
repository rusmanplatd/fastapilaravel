## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite
- Redis (optional, for caching and queues)
- Node.js (for frontend assets)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd fastapilaravel12

# Install dependencies
make install-dev

# Setup database
make db-reset
make db-seed

# Start development server
make dev
```

### Configuration
The application uses Laravel-style configuration in the `config/` directory:
- `database.py` - Database connections
- `oauth2.py` - OAuth2 server settings
- `queue.py` - Queue and job settings

make dev-debug             # Start with debug logging

# Code Quality
make format                # Format code with black/isort
make lint                  # Run all quality checks
make type-check           # Type checking with mypy
make type-check-strict    # Strict type checking

# Database
