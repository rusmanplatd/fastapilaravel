class SoftDeletingScope:
    """
    Laravel-style soft deleting scope for automatic query filtering.
    
    This scope is automatically applied to all queries on models that use the SoftDeletes trait,
    filtering out soft deleted records unless explicitly overridden.
    
    The scope provides three main query states:
    - Default: Excludes soft deleted records (deleted_at IS NULL)  
    - withTrashed(): Includes both deleted and non-deleted records
    - onlyTrashed(): Only includes soft deleted records (deleted_at IS NOT NULL)
    
    Features:
    - Automatic query filtering
    - Performance optimized with database indexes
    - Support for complex query conditions
    - Integration with relationship queries
    - Configurable scope removal
    - Event hooks for scope application
